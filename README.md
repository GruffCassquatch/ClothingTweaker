# Clothing Tweaker

I AM NOT CURRENTLY MAINTAINING THIS OR ANY OTHER MOD. PLEASE DO NOT OPEN ISSUES OR CONTACT ME REGARDING THIS OR ANY OTHER MOD.

A mod for The Long Dark    
FOR GAME VERSION 2.00 / 2.02 (**PRE TALES FROM THE FAR TERRITORY**)    

## Mod features:
* Allows you to adjust the warmth, warmth when wet, windproof, waterproof, protection, mobility and weight of clothing items. 
* Allows you to adjust the decay rates for all clothing items, with separate settings for: decay while not wearing, decay while worn inside, decay while worn outside.

Now you can wear anything you want, instead of the exact same 'best' set of clothes every game! 

Includes support for the clothes added by [ClothingPack](https://github.com/ds5678/Clothing-Pack), [NorthfolkClothingPack](https://github.com/HAHAYOUDEAD/NorthfolkClothingPack), [PrisonPack](https://github.com/TheDevv/Prison-Pack) and [WolfskinScarf](https://github.com/Atlas-Lumi/TLD-WolfskinScarf)   

Based on [FurClothingMod](https://github.com/ds5678/FurClothingMod) by ds5678.

## Limitations:
  * Compatible with [Weight Tweaks](https://github.com/Xpazeman/tld-weight-tweaks), but be aware that if you use BOTH to change clothing weight, the efects are CUMULATIVE. 
      * E.g. set Weight Tweaks "Clothing Modifier" to 0.5 and also set the weight of an item to 1kg in Clothing Tweaker: that item will weigh 0.5kg (1kg x 0.5). 
      * If you only want Weight Tweaks to affect clothing weight, don't change any weight values in Clothing Tweaker.
      * If you only want Clothing Tweaker to affect clothing weight, leave the "Clothing Modifier" setting in Weight Tweaks at 1.00.
  * Compatible with [GearDecayModifier](https://github.com/Xpazeman/tld-gear-decay-modifier), but be aware that if you use BOTH to change clothing decay, the efects are CUMULATIVE. 
      * E.g. set both mods to reduce clothing decay by 50% and you will overall reduce decay by 75% (50% x 50%). 
      * Gear Decay Modifier uses ONE decay rate for all THREE types of decay (worn inside, worn outside, unworn).
      * If you only want Gear Decay Modifier to affect the decay rates, leave the Decay settings in Clothing Tweaker at 'Unchanged'.
      * If you only want Clothing Tweaker to affect the decay rates, leave the "Clothing decay rate" setting in Gear Decay Modifier at 1.
